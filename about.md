## About Me

Hello!

I'm a software developer attempting a move into information security (the game between attackers and private data, and the most common misuse of the word 'hacker'). Whenever I find something I think could be useful represented in a different way, I'll post here.

As a chunk of honesty, the site is also to submit to a job searching fad. The fad suggests a curriculum vitae needs to be augmented with some other presence, called a "professional portfolio" in most of the resources I found. At this point, I don't know how to defeat this trend. I don't like without working full-time as a protestor, so for now I'll join'em. I don't want to end this segment on such a dark note so...

Hope you find something useful here!

## About the Site

If you have any questions comments about the pages (layout, content, language, whatever else), you can ping my Github or Twitter (last time I checked my DM is open). The last thing I want is to have the comments section which overflows with attack code attempts and horrible remarks ;)

FYI, like any other Github Pages page, the stuff that Github's magic parses into what you're looking at now is hosted in a repository https://github.com/patrickceg/patrickceg.github.io
