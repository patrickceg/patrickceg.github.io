## About Me

Hello!

I'm a software developer who likes posting about my 'what does this button do?' moments. I used to only put that stuff in forums, but for purely selfish reasons ("career portfolio"), I'm going to try to collect some of my thoughts here.

## About the Site

If you have any questions comments about the pages (layout, content, language, whatever else), you can ping my Github or Twitter (last time I checked my DM is open). The last thing I want is to have the comments section which overflows with attack code attempts and horrible remarks ;)

FYI, like any other Github Pages page, the stuff that Github's magic parses into what you're looking at now is hosted in a repository https://github.com/patrickceg/patrickceg.github.io
