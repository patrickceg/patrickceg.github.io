I cancelled my [Twitter](https://twitter.com) account.

I used to have a personal Twitter account, but I mismanaged it until it
no longer provided value for me. I used to just use it as a new feed
(to look for new products and service changes from some items I used).
I tried to be slightly more active, but it became more of a liability
than a useful tool after that. Specifically:

* Unless locked down to the point people can't use it to contact you,
  Twitter seems to expose everything including every single action
  you take on it, like following other accounts or liking posts
  * That makes any [OSINT](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3445357/what-is-osint-top-open-source-intelligence-tools.html)
        against you very easy.
  * Sure, there's probably a more convoluted way that gives the
        appearance of making OSINT harder, but after competitor
        [Meta/Facebook's](https://fb.com/)
        [Campbridge Analytica incident](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43465968),
        and similar proven information disclosures, I now assume
        any service that bases its business off sharing personal
        information will not prioritise locking down your
        information against attacks.

* I placed some unrelated items to make OSINT against my Twitter
  noisier, but then it made it useless to me since I had a whole lot of
  irrelevant content.
* Similar to other social media, I just felt it was getting unhealthy
  to use. As some de-cluttering guides said, I wasn't finding joy from
  it, so it was time to let it go.

Unless I post otherwise, `@patrickceg` or similar on Twitter is not me.

As a side note in this experience, if I felt uneasy just having a potentially
risky social media setup, I can't imagine what people who are being
bullied or attacked over social media feel. I'll definitely continue
to donate time and money when I can to efforts that lead to a safer
online experience.
