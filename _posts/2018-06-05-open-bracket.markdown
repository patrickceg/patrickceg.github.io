[TL;DR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn%27t_read): Nothing to see here

Hello, world!

That's how a developer starts off programming, so that's how I'll start this blog :innocent:

I mostly did embedded systems and back-end development, so the last time I created a web page was 2006 - I'm definitely a beginner again!

This post is just a test to see if I can use this platform properly for now.

In the next few weeks, I'll start with some little tech things including backups.

My next bigger plan for the page is to get together some setup to take pictures, then talk about refurbished computers and computer parts: I see little posts here and there either recommending them or to run away, so I'll talk about my experience. As a preview, they work well enough given that this post is created on one.
